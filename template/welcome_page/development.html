    <h2>What Is Autoware</h2>
    <p>Autoware is ROS-based open-source software, enabling self-driving mobility to perform in open city areas. It provides, but not limited to, the following modules. <i>Localization</i> is achieved by 3D maps and SLAM algorithms in combination with GNSS and IMU sensors. <i>Detection</i> uses cameras and LiDARs with sensor fusion algorithms and deep neural networks. <i>Prediction</i> and <i>Planning</i> are based on probabilistic robotics and rule-based systems, partly using deep neural networks as well. The output of Autoware to the vehicle is a twist of velocity and angular velocity (also curvature). This is a part of <i>Control</i>, though the major part of <i>Control</i> is supposed to reside in the by-ware controller of the vehicle, where PID and MPC algorithms are often adopted. All in all, Autoware provides a complete software stack for self-driving technology. Join Autoware now, and your contribution will be there.</p>

    <h2>How To Contribute</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Coding</li>
      <p>Autoware is managed by GitHub at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cpfl/Autoware">https://github.com/cpfl/Autoware</a>. You are always welcome to fork it and send your contribution as a pull request to the repository. Whenever you contribute to coding of Autoware modules, however, please respect and follow our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/master/docs/en/branching_model.md">branching model</a> policy so that the repository can keep organized. To install Autoware, we strongly recommend you using our Docker environments: [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.autoware.ai/docker_x86/">Generic x86</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://www.autoware.ai/docker_px2/">DRIVE PX2</a>]. Otherwise, you can visit <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cpfl/Autoware">https://github.com/cpfl/Autoware</a>, and follow the instructions in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>.</p>
      <li>Field Testing</li>
      <p>Autoware is widely used in research and development of self-driving technology. The most highlighted story of Autoware is its high-quality capability for field testing. So far many Autoware-based self-driving cars have shown amazing demonstrations of on public roads. A remarkable example is that Udacity has adopted Autoware (see the <a target="_blank" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Udacity-Tier-IV-tie-up-in-driverless-car-development">story</a>) for their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013">Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program</a>, and one spinout team has made a successful field demonstration on El Camino Real, CA (see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/voyage-autonomous-taxi-udacity-2017-4">story</a>). Other examples include: [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUqOzfgc4UY&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU&index=7">Palo Alto</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYpRhh3wGPo&index=8&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU">Ros Gatos</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaQBZvZwAI&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU&index=6">Aichi, Japan</a>]. It is also impressive that a few Japanese teams have shown Autoware-based driverless cars, one of the world's first driverless cars on public roads: [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RimuPT6e-Oo&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU&index=9">Shimane</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1uM65zaVQc&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU&index=10">Toyama</a>][<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQwIC2wZlzQ&list=PLMV3EZ9zjNbIkOWvjaY2iU8LVC-pUQMOU&index=11">Tokushima</a>]. The first media coverage of Autoware-based driverless car is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IX1uUjrF7M">here</a>. We appreciate many successors of field testing. Please also upload your ROSBAG files recorded during field testing to <a target="_blank" href="https://rosbag.tier4.jp">ROSBAG STORE</a> so that other Autoware and ROS users who do not own cars can reproduce the scenes and simulate the functions.</p>

      <li>Production</li>
      <p>Autoware can also be used for products and services. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tier4.jp">Tier IV</a> offers a compact self-driving development kit, called <a target="_blank" href="http://tier4.jp/en/computers.php">AI Pilot</a>, where cameras, LiDAR, GPS/IMU, and computers (DRIVE PX2, etc.) are all integrated in a package. <a target="_blank" href="https://autonomoustuff.com/">AutonomouStuff</a> distributes <a target="_blank" href="https://autonomoustuff.com/product/astuff-automotive/">by-wire vehicles</a>, where Autoware can be preinstalled as an option. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zmp.co.jp">ZMP</a> also distributes Autoware-preinstalled vehicles. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aisantec.co.jp/english/">Aisan Technology</a> provides high-definition/accuracy/resolution 3D maps that use the mapping format supported by Autoware (see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClndQXbGrlo_cWR7tzu5LOQ">videos</a>). We appreciate these companies selecting Autoware as a commercial solution, and hope to see more and more companies adopting Autoware in production.</p>
